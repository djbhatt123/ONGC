# ONGC
The 1 month winter Training at ONGC provided me with a
holistic understanding of the company's operations. I gained invaluable Insights
into the operations of gas gensets, diesel gensets, light machines, heavy
machines, and fabrication. This encompassed not only understanding their
components but also learning about their maintenance and upkeep.
